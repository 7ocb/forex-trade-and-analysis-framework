//
// The class FairMonitor implements a Java-style monitor in Win32. The
// monitor guarantees FIFO treatment of waiting threads. The price for
// this "fairness guarantee" is the use of a significant amount of
// user-mode code in the Wait(), Notify(), and NotifyAll() functions.
// See thbecker.net/free_software_utilities/fair_monitor_for_win32/start_page.html
// for a detailed discussion of monitors and fairness under Win32.
//
// Anybody who has used monitors in Java or under pthreads should need
// no more documentation than this header file.

class FairMonitor
{
public:

  // Public Construction and Destruction
  // ===================================
  
  // Default constructor.
  FairMonitor();

  // NOTE: If you must derive from this class (which you should not, but I
  // cannot currently enforce it), then you must make the destructor virtual.
  ~FairMonitor();

  // Operations
  // ==========
  
  // Acquires the lock once. There is no error checking as the lock is
  // implemented as a Win32 critical section.
  void BeginSynchronized();

  // Releases the lock once. As the lock is implemented as a Win32 
  // critical section, no error checking is possible on the system
  // call that releases the lock. However, the function does check
  // whether the calling thread currently holds the lock. If not,
  // FALSE is returned and the last error is set to 
  // ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (for the lack of better).
  BOOL EndSynchronized();

  // Waits for a notification. The argument is the timeout
  // in milliseconds, defaulting to INFINITE.
  //
  // In case of success, the return value is WAIT_OBJECT_0. See
  // the documentation of the Win32 function WaitForSingleObjectEx()
  // for an explanation of the other possible return values.
  //
  // The function checks whether or not the lock has been acquired by
  // the calling thread prior to calling this function. If that is not
  // the case, WAIT_FAILED is returned and the last error is set to 
  // ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (for the lack of better).
  //
  // If WAIT_FAILED is returned for a reason other than the one
  // discussed above, then that indicates an irrecoverably bad
  // state of the process, usually caused by a bad API call such as 
  // entering or leaving a destroyed critical section.
  //
  // Since the lock is implemented as a Win32 critical section,
  // no error checking can be performed on the system calls that
  // aquire or release the lock. 
  DWORD Wait(DWORD dwMillisecondsTimeout = INFINITE);

  // Notifies one of the waiting threads, if any. In case of success, 
  // the return value is TRUE. In case of failure, call GetLastError()
  // to obtain error information.
  //
  // The function checks whether the calling thread currently holds
  // the lock. If not, FALSE is returned and the last error is set to 
  // ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (for the lack of better).
  //
  // The return value FALSE indicates an irrecoverrably bad state
  // of the process, usually caused by a bad API call such entering or
  // leaving a destroyed critical section.
  BOOL Notify();

  // Notifies the waiting threads, if any. In case of success, the 
  // return value is TRUE. In case of failure, call GetLastError() to 
  // obtain error information.
  //
  // The function checks whether the calling thread currently holds
  // the lock. If not, FALSE is returned and the last error is set to 
  // ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (for the lack of better).
  //
  // The return value FALSE indicates an irrecoverrably bad state
  // of the process, usually caused by a bad API call such entering or
  // leaving a destroyed critical section.
  BOOL NotifyAll();

private:

  // Private helper functions
  // ========================
  
  // Creates an initially non-signalled auto-reset event and
  // pushes the handle to the event onto the wait set. The
  // return value is the event handle. In case of failure,
  // NULL is returned.
  HANDLE Push();

  // Pops the first handle off the wait set. Returns NULL if the
  // wait set was empty.
  HANDLE Pop();

  // Erases the given handle from the wait set, if it is present.
  // Returns TRUE if the handle was found, FALSE otherwise.
  BOOL Erase(HANDLE hWaitEvent);

  // Checks whether the calling thread is holding the lock.
  BOOL LockHeldByCallingThread();

  // The intended use of the monitor never requires any value copies.
  // Therefore, the class is non-copyable.
